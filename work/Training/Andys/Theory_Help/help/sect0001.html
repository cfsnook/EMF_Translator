<div><h1 id="a0000000002">1 Motivation</h1>
<p> Work on the Theory plug-in started as an effort to create a <i class="itshape">Rule-based Prover</i> for Event-B much like the ML prover in Atelier-B. The Rule-based Prover, as it was known then, supported the definition, validation and use of rewrite rules. The Theory plug-in is the successor of the Rule-based Prover, and offers much more functionality. </p><p>Prior to Rodin v2.0, the mathematical language used in Event-B was fixed. As such, it was not possible to define reusable polymorphic operators. A workaround was to define any required operators as set constructs in contexts. Originally, contexts were supposed to provide a parametrization of machines. The aforementioned limitations of the Event-B language lead to users to use contexts for purposes for which they were not intentionally devised. Examples of operators that can be useful to users include the sequence operator (which was present in classical B mathematical language) and the bag operator. </p><p>In Rodin v2.0, a dynamic parser has been implemented for the Event-B AST. The Theory plug-in was a natural candidate for defining and using mathematical extensions. To provide a comprehensive platform, cover for a wider range of proof rules was also needed. </p><p><img src="images/img-0002.png" alt="\includegraphics{images/info.png}" style="width:24px; height:24px" />
 ML is a rule-based prover as opposed to the semi-decision procedure PP. </p></div>
