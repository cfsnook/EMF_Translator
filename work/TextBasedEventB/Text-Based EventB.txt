Event-B Editor - Initial Release
================================

The first release of the Text-Based EventB Editor provides a feature to translate a text-based Event-B specification into Rodin (machines and contexts), and conversely from Rodin models (machines and contexts) into text. The first version of the tool will not translate state-machines, but it is expected in the next iteration. If a machine with a state-machine (or any non-core feature) is translated into text, and then back into Rodin, the non-core features will be lost. 

The editor is XText-based, and offers content proposal, and navigable cross-references (eg navigate to 'refines' machines). You can edit text and rodin models in the same project. Just add the xtext nature, to an existing Event-B Project. 


Installation
============ 

To install the Text-Based EventB Editor, you will need to add the XText update site to your list of 'available software sites':

http://download.itemis.de/updates/releases/

and add the new 'Text-Based EventB Editor' update site.

Install in the usual way.


Use
===

Machine and Context file extensions, for text-based EventB are, .mch and .ctx respectively.

To make the .mch and .ctx files visible in the EventB Navigator, a new filter has been added, which filters all but EventB, and Text-Based EventB. To add this ................

To use Text-Based EventB: you will need to configure each Text-Based EventB Project to work with XText. To do this: right-click on a project, in the explorer, and select configure > add xtext nature.

When editing an existing Rodin machine or context, using the Rodin Editor (or the form-based editor) a button will be highlighted in the toolbar, above. The icon is a right arrow, pointing to a T (for text), -->T. Selecting this will translate the Rodin model to text, and open the text-based editor for editing.

When editing using the new Text-Based EventB editor, another button will be highlighted. This time a right arrow pointing away from the T, T-->. Selecting this will translate from Text to a rodin model, and open the rodin editor for editing.
