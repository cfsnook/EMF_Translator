Event-B Editor - Initial Release
================================

The first release of the Text-Based Event-B Editor provides features to translate a text-based Event-B specification into Rodin (machines and contexts), and conversely from Rodin models (machines and contexts) into text. Text-based Event-B files are persisted as plain text. The first version of the tool will not translate state-machines, but it is expected in the next iteration. If a rodin machine with a state-machine (or any non-core feature) is translated into text, and then back into Rodin, the non-core features will be lost. 

- The editor is XText based, and offers content proposal, navigable cross-references (eg navigate to 'refines' machines) etc, as provided by XText. 
- Text-based and Rodin-based models reside in the same project, just add the xtext nature to a project to use the text-based editor. 
- Translation to rodin or text overwrites existing files with the same name. 
- The Event-B keyboard is enabled, so that the usual shortcuts can be used; it is enabled in comments too, but we will review this in future work.

Installation
============ 

To install the Text-based Event-B Editor, you will need to add the XText update site to your list of 'available software sites':

http://download.itemis.de/updates/releases/

There is no need to install XText, the Text-based Event-B update site will acquire the required plug-ins. But, if you do want to install XText separately, you will need version 2.6.2, not the latest 2.7.x

Then add the new 'Text-based Event-B Editor' update site.

Install the Text-based Event-B Editor in the usual way.



The plug-in has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (x86-64)


Use
===

To use Text-based Event-B you will need to add an XText project nature to any projectthat you wish to use. You add this to an existing Event-B Project, so it can work with XText, or create a new project and add the nature. To add the XText nature, right-click on a project in the Event-B explorer, and select configure > add xtext nature.

Machine and Context file extensions, for text-based Event-B files are, .mch and .ctx respectively. To make the .mch and .ctx files visible in the Event-B explorer view, a new filter has been added, which filters all but Event-B, and Text-based Event-B files. When the plug-in is first insatlled the default setting is for the filter to be enabled. But, you may not see the files since the 'hide all non-rodin files' filter is a typical default and overrides it; 'hide non-rodin' should be disabled in the customize view menu (found at the top-right of the Event-B explorer by selecting the triangular icon). The new icons for text-based editor should become visible in the explorer view.

When editing an existing Rodin machine or context, using the Rodin Editor (or the form-based editor) a green button will be highlighted in the toolbar. The icon is a right arrow, pointing to a T (for text) -->T. Selecting this will translate the Rodin model to text, and open the text-based editor for editing. The name for the editors are MachineDSL and ContextDSL.

When editing using the new Text-Based Event-B editor, another green button will be highlighted. This time a right arrow pointing away from the T, T-->. Selecting this will translate from Text to a Rodin model, and open the Rodin Editor for editing.
