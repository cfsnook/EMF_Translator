\begin{abstract}
Event-B is a formal set-theoretic approach to modelling systems in the safety-critical, and business-critical, domains. This article describes an extension to the Event-B approach, which we call Tasking Event-B, that facilitates automatic generation of source code, from annotated Event-B models. Tasking Event-B allows specification of multi-tasking implementations. We believe that automatic code-generation makes a useful contribution to the Rodin tool-set, by contributing a link in a coherent tool-chain. Automatically generating code from the Event-B model can be seen as a productivity enhancement. It removes a source of errors, that of manually coding for each development. To validate the approach we have undertaken case studies and taken part in an industrial collaboration. We present a number of case-studies to illustrate our work, in this article.
