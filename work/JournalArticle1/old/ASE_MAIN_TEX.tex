% Abstract
%
\begin{abstract}
Event-B is a formal modelling approach, with good tool support, for use in safety-, and business-critical systems. The methodology supports hierarchical, structured specification, beginning with a high-level abstraction of the system. Detail is added in successive refinement steps, progressing towards implementation. Bridging the abstraction gap, between the modelling and implementation, is addressed in the work that we describe here. Since, at the implementation level, we are concerned with implementation specifics we have chosen to narrow the application domain to that of multi-tasking, embedded control systems. We show how, from an Event-B model, we can generate an abstract model of an implementation, and from this we can generate code. Using an approach that is extensible, we developed back-end code generators for Java, Ada, OpenMP-C and C conforming to the Functional Mock-up Interface for Co-simulation of Cyber-Physical Systems. The extensibility mechanism makes use of the Theory component for translation the mathematical language of Event-B to the target programming language. The approach has been formulated so that it integrates well with the existing Event-B methodology and tools. Event-B is extended with AutoTask, Shared, and Environ machines. We use these features to specify how elements should be translated to code, i.e. controller tasks, protected objects and environment tasks. Using refinement, decomposition, and the extension, we structure projects so that they are amenable to automatic code generation. This necessitates the introduction of a great deal of low-level detail into the specification; so models grow in size considerably. To ensure models remain tractable, we decompose the models (perhaps a number of times). Decomposition encourages modular reasoning, and makes proof more tractable. We make use of an Event-B Composed machine to record the link between the decomposed model. To validate the approach we undertook case-studies, which we use as a running example.
