for use in critical systems.
(4 marks)

ANSWER
It is a safe subset of the language which is amenable to formal verification. It is
an established technology. Different levels of analysis can be used, data flow,
information flow, and formal proof. Ada is strongly typed


(e) For the e-mail system, identify and distinguish between
the tasks and shared components.
(1 marks)

ANSWER
Tasks = message servers, reader process, writer process
Shared = message send buffer, message recieve buffer

(f) In a situation where message sending is performed in a safety
critical/secure system, What are the considerations relating to the
sending/receipt of messages? (Think about what could go wrong when sending/receiving
message, and what you need, to ensure safe/secure operation).
(3 marks)

ANSWER
Parts of the message content should be not be missing (Use hashing).

.....

(h) Write down an event that models sending a character in a
message. Define and explain any variables you use in the guard
and the action.

(i) Write down the event of part (h) above, prepared for decomposition.
It should be refined by adding a parameter to the event. Explain
briefly why you need to do this.
