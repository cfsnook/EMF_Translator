why do we want templates?
 different targets, but core is the same
 doesn't change between models, don't want to hard code.

 CG set-up : theory for math-lang + hard-coded for 
 tasking mch to tasks.
 environ mch to tasks.
 shared mch to protected objects.


introduce Co-simulation with FMI
 master - slaves - cycle
 the API

introduce code generation process
strike-through master, but else the same.


the new approach:
 Tags use - example
 Template processor architecture
 Extension point for markup/IGenerator
 Generators and Templates diagram.
 IGenerator Example
 what calls the generator - example
